Assessment TITLE : Machine Learning and Data Mining with Python and Azure Machine Learning Studio

The purpose of the project are listed below:
a. To use the classification algoritms to predict the bidding behaviour of a bidder also to compare the 
   performance metrics such as: accuracy, precision, F1 score and recall of the classifiers.
b. To use two clustering algorithms to segregate customers into groups
c. To use association rule mining/masket masket analysis to find frequent itemsets using measures such as support, confidence, and lift.
d. To use sentiment analysis and text mining to detect and classify customer sentiments based on their experiences.
